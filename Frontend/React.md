# React


- **React** is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs), especially websites and web applications.

- It was created by **Facebook (Meta)** and is one of the most popular tools in frontend development.

**React** = A tool that lets you build fast, dynamic, and interactive web pages using components.


## Key Features of React:
1. **Component-Based**: React allows you to build UIs using reusable components, which are like building blocks for your application.

2. **Virtual DOM**: React updates the UI without reloading the entire page.
It only updates the part that changed → makes the app very fast.

3. **Reusable Code** : You can build a component once and use it many times.

4. **JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code.

## What is JSX?
- JSX = JavaScript + HTML together
It looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript.


```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```
 **JSX makes UI building easier and cleaner.**
