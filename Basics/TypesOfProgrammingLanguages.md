# **Types of programming languages**

Programming languages -> It is a set of instructions that are used to communicate with the computer.
its serves as a bridge between humans understanding and machine operations.

### **why do we need programming languages?**

because the computer only understands binary language(0,1) and it is difficult for humans to communicate with the computer in binary language.
so, we need programming languages to communicate with the computer.

### **programming langages consists of** :
 - **Syntax** -> It is a set of rules that defines the correct structur programs.
 - **Semantics** -> It is the meaning of the program.
 - **Compiler / Interpreter** -> It is a program that translates the source code into machine code.

### **Types of programming languages**:

1. **Based on machine instructions**:

	|Type|Description|Example|
	|----|-----------|-------|
	|low-level language|Directly interact with hardware,dificult to understand.|Machine Language|
    |high-level language|Closer to humen language ,easier to write understand.|Python, Java, C++|

2. **Based on Execution Method**:
 
	|Type|Description|Example|
	|----|-----------|-------|
	|Compiled language|It is translated into machine code before execution.|C, C++|
	|Interpreted language|It is translated into machine code during execution.|Python, Ruby|
    |Hybrid language|It is a combination of compiled and interpreted languages.|Java|


3. **Based on programming paradigm** :

	|Type|Description|Example|
	|----|-----------|-------|
    |Procedural programming|It is a code writtin step by step |C|
	|Functional programming| Focuses on pure functions and immutability .|Haskell,JavaScript|
	|Object-Oriented programming|Code is structured using objects and class.|Java, C++|
