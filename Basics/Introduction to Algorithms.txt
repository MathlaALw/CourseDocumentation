Introduction to Algorithms


Types of Algorithms
1. Sequential Algorithm

Finding the Sum of Two Numbers:

1- Git 2 num from user
2- Add them toghether
3- Return sum


2. Iterative Algorithm 
Finding Factorial of a Number (Iterative):

1- Git input
2- set result=1
3- start from 1 and multiply the result by each number upto the input number
4- return result


3. Recursive Algorithm


1- If the number is 0 or 1, return 1
2- Otherwise, multiply the number by the factorial of (number - 1)
3- Keep calling itself until reaching 1



Algorithms Examples:
1. Find the Largest Number in a List

1- Assign LargNum to x -> x=the first num in the List
2- Compare LargNum with x -> LargNum >x
3- Set new LargNum 
4- Increse x by 1 


2. Count the Number of Vowels in a String

1- Assign count to 0
2- Go throw the String for each letter  
3- If letter is "a","e","i","o" or "u"
4- Increse count by 1 until the String finish ->String = 0
5- Return count


3. Reverse a String

1- calculate num of Char Assign to y
2- Create Empty List assign to z then insert the last char y
3- Decrese y by 1 to git letter befor the last letter
4- Increse z by 1 to move to the 2 space in list
