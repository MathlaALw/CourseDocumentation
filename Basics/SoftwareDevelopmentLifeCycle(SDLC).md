### **Phases of SDLC**:
1. **Analysis** 

	**Role in Software Development:**	
	     - Understand business needs and client requirements.Analyze project plan.

	**Input:**				
	     - Business requirements and Client needs.

	     - Software requirements specification (SRS), Project Plan.

	**Roles:**

	**Product Owner** -> Managing and prioritizing the product.
    
	**Project Manager** -> Manages the project and determines the project duration. Manage team schedules, budgets and risks. (Trello and Microsoft Project)
    
	**Business Analyst** -> Gather and document requirements from clients. (Jira and Microsoft Excel)
    
	**CTO (Chief Technology Officer)** -> Specifies the programs used to work on the project.
	
2. **Design** 

	**Role in Software Development:**
		 - Design the software architecture and user interface.

	**Input:**
		 - Software requirements specification (SRS).

	**Output:**
		 - Software design document.

	**Roles:**

	**Software Architect** -> Design the software architecture.

	**UI/UX Designer** -> Design the user interface.


3. **Development** 

	**Role in Software Development:**
		 - Develop the software based on the design.

	**Input:**
		 - Software design document.

	**Output:**
		 - Software code.

	**Roles:**
	
	**Frontend Developer** -> Develop the user interface.
	
	**Backend Developer** -> Develop the backend of the software.

4. **Testing** 

	**Role in Software Development:**
		 - Test the software to ensure it meets the requirements.

	**Input:**
		 - Software code.

	**Output:**
		 - Test report.

	**Roles:**

	**Quality Assurance Engineer** -> Test the software to ensure it meets the requirements.

	**Software Tester** -> Test the software to ensure it meets the requirements.

	**Solution Architect** -> Test the software to ensure it meets the requirements.

	**DevOps Engineer** -> Test the software to ensure it meets the requirements.
	
5. **Deployment** 

	**Role in Software Development:**
		 - DEnsure a smooth transition from development to production.

	**Input:**
		 - Software code.

	**Output:**
		 - Deployed software.

	**Roles:**

	**DevOps Engineer** -> Designs and manages database.

	**DevOps Engineer** -> Manage Deployment. ( Azure, Google Cloud).

6. **Maintenance** 

	**Role in Software Development:**
		 - Maintain and update the software as needed.
	
	**Input:**
		 - Deployed software.

	**Output:**
		- Updated software.
